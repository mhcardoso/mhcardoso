### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Junior Site Reliability Engineer working at CODE in Volkswagen Digital Solutions.

- I'm currently a part of the GroupFind CORE project;
- I'm learning the basics of Site Reliability Engineering, from Infrastrucure as Code to Monitoring and Alerting.

Please don't ask me stuff because I don't know stuff. 
Eventually I might, though, and I might even edit this to look better.
